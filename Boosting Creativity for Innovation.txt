Successful contemporary business relies on the ability of its employees to be creative. This course helped me gain a set of strategies that I could hopefully deploy to tackle challenges with a fresh perspective.
Thanks to Professor Anne-Laure Sellier for making the course extremely engaging even though it was online.
